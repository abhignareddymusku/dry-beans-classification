# Dry-Beans_Multiclass-Classification

This repository contains code for building an effective classification model that can accurately identify and classify 7 types of Drybeans based on their physical characteristics and properties.All the models used were implemented from Scratch.

Currently, 3 algorithms have been used for Classification: 1)Logistic Regression 2)Support Vector Machines 3)Neural Networks

The data for the analysis is taken from UC Irvine’s Machine Learning Repository's Dry Beans Dataset:- https://archive-beta.ics.uci.edu/dataset/602/dry+bean+dataset

We worked on this project as a group of 3 as part of the Statistical Learning in Engineering course [ IE 7300 ]. I took the lead on comprehensive technical documentation and analysis. My work involved:

Created a comprehensive technical report explaining how all three models (Logistic Regression, SVM, and Neural Networks) work and their implementation details
Documented key findings from exploratory data analysis, including feature correlations and class imbalance issues
Provided strategic recommendations on model selection based on the accuracy-speed tradeoff analysis
